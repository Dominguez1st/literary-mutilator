			These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to
			seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the
			homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a
			protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the
			resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

			We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering
			by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and
			forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an
			abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

			It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral
			cortex, the brain stem,  the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device
			like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective
			molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter
			the photons with phase discriminators.
