				These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to
				seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the
				homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a
				protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the
				resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

				We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering
				by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and
				forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an
				abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

				It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral
				cortex, the brain stem,  the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device
				like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective
				molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter
				the photons with phase discriminators.
